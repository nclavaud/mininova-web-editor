This project is a Linux-friendly alternative to the official Mininova Editor VST plugin.
It allows you to control the Novation Mininova synth from your web browser, so you don't
have to deep dive into the hardware controls.

This application runs in any web browser that supports the Web MIDI API specification (see the
[list of compatible browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIAccess#Browser_compatibility)
).
